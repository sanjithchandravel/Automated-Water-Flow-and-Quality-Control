# Automated-Water-Flow-and-Quality-Control

## Overview

This project focuses on monitoring and controlling water levels and quality in a tank or reservoir using automated methods. It integrates sensors to detect overflow conditions and measure water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, and chemical composition. The system aims to reduce water wastage by automatically shutting off water input when overflow is detected and to ensure water safety by constantly monitoring quality metrics.

## Features

- **Overflow Detection**: Detects when water reaches the maximum level and triggers actions to prevent overflow.
- **Quality Monitoring**: Measures key water quality indicators and raises alerts if they exceed safe levels.
- **Automated Alerts and Control**: Sends real-time notifications and performs automatic adjustments based on sensor readings.
- **Data Logging**: Records water quality metrics and overflow events for analysis and reporting.

## Components

### Hardware

- **Arduino Board**: The microcontroller used to handle sensor data and control the system.
- **Water Level Sensor**: Monitors water level and detects overflow conditions.
- **pH Sensor**: Measures the pH level of the water.
- **Turbidity Sensor**: Detects water clarity, indicating the presence of suspended particles.
- **Relay Module**: Controls water flow based on sensor inputs.
- **Other Sensors (Optional)**: Additional sensors for measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc.

### Software

- **Arduino Sketch (code.ino)**: Handles sensor readings, data processing, and control logic for overflow and quality control.
- **Python Scripts ([app.py](http://app.py/), [file.py](http://file.py/))**: Used for data logging, alert generation, and communication with external services (e.g., for sending notifications).
- **Backend Service**: Processes and stores data in a database (optional for advanced analytics and visualization).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect all sensors to the Arduino according to the circuit diagram, ensuring proper connections and configurations.
2. **Arduino Code Upload**: Upload the `code.ino` file to the Arduino board.
3. **Run the Python Scripts**: Start the monitoring script:
    
    ```bash
    python app.py
    
    ```
    

## Usage

1. **Monitoring**: The system continuously checks water levels and quality parameters.
2. **Overflow Prevention**: If overflow is detected, the system triggers the relay to stop the water pump.
3. **Quality Alerts**: If water quality falls below thresholds, notifications are sent to the user.
